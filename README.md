```

## Usage

### mumble

``` lua
-- Connect to a mumble server
-- Returns nil and an error string if something went wrong
mumble.client, [ String error ] = mumble.connect(String host, Number port, String certificate file path, String key file path)

-- Main loop that handles all events, ping, and audio processing
-- This will block the script until disconnect or SIGINT, so call this *after* you create your hooks
mumble.loop()

-- The client's user
mumble.user = mumble.client.me

-- A new voicetarget object
mumble.voicetarget = mumble.voicetarget()

-- A timestamp in milliseconds
Number time = mumble.gettime()
```

### mumble.client
